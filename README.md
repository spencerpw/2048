# 2048

## Can I clone 2048 in 8 hours?

This is a simple exercise to try and get a playable version of 2048 made in Unity within a single work day. Emphasis is on functionality and speed, therefore code will not be super clean. Solutions will likely be whatever I think of first rather than what is most optimal.

## Features
- 4x4 grid containing number tiles
- Number tiles on grid with different coloured backgrounds
- Arrow keys or touch gestures to slide all tiles in a direction
- When tiles of the same value collide, they combine
- Start the game with two tiles each with a value of either 2 or 4
- After each slide a new tile is generated that is either 2 or 4
- After each slide, check if there is a tile with value 2048, if so the player wins
- After each slide, check if the board is full and if there are any tiles of the same value side by side. If not game over

 
## Controls

On Mac/PC use arrow keys. On a mobile device swipe up, down, left or right. Tap or hit enter to restart after a game over.
